Description:
Campus Marketplace is a full-stack web application designed to facilitate smooth, secure, and easy buying and selling of items among university students. The platform enables students to list used items like books, electronics, and furniture, and connect directly with peers looking to purchase them—creating a trusted, campus-specific ecosystem.

Key Features:

🔍 Item Listings & Search: Students can post items for sale with images, prices, and descriptions. Buyers can filter and search by category, price, or keywords.

👤 User Authentication: Secure login and signup functionality to ensure only verified campus users can access the platform.

💬 Chat System (Optional): Real-time messaging between buyers and sellers (if implemented).

📁 Categories & Tags: Organized item browsing through categories like Books, Electronics, Furniture, etc.

🎨 Minimal, Modern UI: Inspired by platforms like Linear.app to keep the user experience clean, intuitive, and responsive across devices.

Impact:
This project solves a common problem on campuses by reducing waste and making affordable resources accessible to students. It encourages sustainability and peer collaboration while giving students a practical platform built entirely by students.
